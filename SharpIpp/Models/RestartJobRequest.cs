    ///     This OPTIONAL operation allows a client to restart a job that is
    ///     retained in the queue after processing has completed.
    ///     The job is moved to the 'pending' or 'pending-held' job state and
    ///     restarts at the beginning on the same IPP Printer object with the
    ///     same attribute values.  If any of the documents in the job were
    ///     passed by reference (Print-URI or Send-URI), the Printer MUST re-
    ///     fetch the data, since the semantics of Restart-Job are to repeat all
    ///     Job processing.  The Job Description attributes that accumulate job
    ///     progress, such as "job-impressions-completed", "job-media-sheets-
    ///     completed", and "job-k-octets-processed", MUST be reset to 0 so that
    ///     they give an accurate record of the job from its restart point.  The
    ///     job object MUST continue to use the same "job-uri" and "job-id"
    ///     attribute values.
